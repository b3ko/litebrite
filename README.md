My daughter got a lite-brite by hasbro as a gift.
http://www.hasbro.com/litebrite/en_US/
it comes with black paper with dots on it.
this helps you line the pegs up with the holes.
She put a hole in the wrong place and wanted an "undo".
but moving the peg leaves a hole for light (or should i say lite) to come through.
i thought i could improve on this by making a web based version.

TO DO:
add a list of saved drawings making it easier to load
test on ipad and iphone to see if it works / make it work.
